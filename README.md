# image_based_localization

IBL(image based localization), using mmdetection recognize target and calculate the localization in the world coordinate system.

## Introduction

This repo introduces how to use mmdetection recognize target and calculate the localization in the world coordinate system.

And through this repo, you can calculate the target localization in the world coordinate system.
